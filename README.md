# Dzhanibekov-Effect-Blender-Simulation
A .blend file that demonstrates the Dzhanibekov effect.

Create using blender 2.77a

Open it in the blender, game engine mode, to start press 'p' while the mouse is in the 3d view,
then tap 's' to apply some torque.

A youtube tutorial video of it can be seen here, https://youtu.be/kXwS-3Uy3WI
